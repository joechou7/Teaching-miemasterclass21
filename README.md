# MIE Summer Master Class'21 - WIP

### Welcome to the MIE Master Class on 'Computational Optimization for Data Analytics'.

Prof. Chou delivers this lecture with the support of MIE Department, Northeastern University, and acknowledges the contributions from MOCA Lab's students, Tushar Sharma, Ruilin Ouyang, Qingtao Cao, and Yuchun Zou.

### Prerequisites
Here are a few prerequisites that will help in better understanding the concepts used in this research technique.
- Predictive Analytics, Supervised learning and Bayes' Theorem
- Association rule mining and its evaluation metrics
- Operation Research basics such as MIP (Mixed Integer Programming)

### Installation
You can find the content used in the session in this repository. Please follow these steps to use the tutorial in the jupyter notebook.

1. Clone the repository at your local directory using following command.
```
 git clone https://github.com/joechou7/miemasterclass21.git
```
2. Please follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/joechou7/miemasterclass21/blob/main/Python%20%26%20Gurobi%20Installation%20Guide%202021.pdf) and make sure to get gurobi license.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and start using.

### Dataset Description:

We will be using the ARSOM technique on the following two datasets-
1. **Toydata**: This is a small dummy dataset used for explaining the working of ARSOM in a fundamental way. Students will be able to grasp the working of different functions used in the code and the underlying principles with this data .
2. **ICU Transfer**: This dataset is an industrial example of using ARSOM to optimize decision making process. We gather data from a hospital's medical records for ICU transfer decisions for patients, their medical history and biometric symptoms. The size of this dataset is large and might take too long to run on slower machines.
